# Curbside-parking
Codes and Data Related to Digitizing the Last Mile of Urban Goods to Improve the Curb Access and Utilization Project.

This section of the study is being conducted as part of an ongoing research project at the University of Washington-Urban Freight Lab in collaboration with the Seattle Department of Transportation (SDOT). The purpose of this part is to design a survey to seek inputs from carriers and commercial establishments operating commercial vehicles in Seattle. The survey is structured into four sections:
1. Company information
2. Vehicle routing and parking experience (if applicable)
3. Experience with the existing Commercial Vehicle Load Zone (CVLZ) program (if applicable)
4. Reaction to future CVLZ program scenarios.
